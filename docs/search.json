    "text": "3.12 Adhere to Simon Willison‚Äôs Personal AI Ethics\nSimon Willison had a great talk in August 2023 on Making Large Language Models work for you. In the talk, he shared his personal AI ethical guidelines which included the following (watch the talk to learn why):\n\nDon‚Äôt publish anything that will take someone longer to read than it took you to write.\nNever commit code you can‚Äôt understand and explain every line of.\nShare your prompts and help spread knowledge of how to use these tools\nBe aware of the harm of these AI tools to believably mimic humans. Instead of responses that mimic humans, ask tools like ChatGPT to be a sentient cheesecake or a Shakespearean coal miner. The responses are safer, more entertaining, and stick better."
