This is relevant in the pharma industry for clinical trial reporting, but could also be useful broadly in academia for internal or external replication of code. In the future, one could imagine a code validation LLM tool that could run in parallel or as a replacement to the validation programmers. This needs to be approached with care to ensure the production and validation programmer are not using an AI assistance tool for their work which may lead to errors being missed in the validation process."
