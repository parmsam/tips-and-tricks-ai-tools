It's like an arrow showing you the way to the beginning of the line.\n\nCarat to Ceiling, Dollar to Down:\nAssociate the shape of the ^ (caret) to ceiling and $ (dollar) to down or the floor. This way you remember the caret matches the start (top/ceiling) and the dollar matches the end (bottom/down).\n\n\"$\" at the End of a Price:\nWhen we list prices, we often write the dollar sign at the end (especially in some non-English-speaking countries). So, the dollar sign can remind you of the end of the line.\n\nAlphabetical Order:\nIn terms of alphabetical order, Carat comes before Dollar. This can be associated with the order in a line: Carat (^) represents the start (before), and Dollar ($) represents the end (after)."
