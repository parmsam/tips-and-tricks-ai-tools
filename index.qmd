# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a guidance book with tips and tricks for use of AI tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Bard](https://bard.google.com/), [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2). It collects different use cases that I've run into as a programmer. Example prompts are provided with most of the use cases. This book is created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It's hosted on Github pages, with the source code available on [Github](https://github.com/parmsam/tips-and-tricks-ai-tools). Please consider starring the Github repository if you find this book useful.
