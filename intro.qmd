# Uses

## Memory aid

Obtain list of possible mnemonics to help memorize a concept. These could be an acronym or funny story. Alternatively, you could ask for a description to help you map the information into your memory palace.

``` markdown
Give me a list of 5 memory devices to remember
$ vs ^ in regular expressions
```

## Transforming information

Summarize educational content into a list of bullet points or table. Content be a video transcript or an article. Or you could go in the opposite direction and ask for a description of a table or set of bullet points.

```markdown
Here's the transcript from a Youtube video I just saw. Give me a short summary of in 4 bullet points:

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
```

```markdown
- The lyrics are from the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.
- The song talks about a person's commitment and dedication to their loved one.
- The singer emphasizes that they will never give up, let down, or hurt their partner.
- The overall message is about reassurance, trust, and the desire to make their loved one happy.
```
### Generate diagrams

Visualize code, relationships or project info as a diagrams or charts in Mermaid.

```markdown
Give me an accurate Mermaid flow chart for this R code: 
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i < 3) 
    next
  print(i)
  if (i >= 5)
    break
}
```

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-height: 6
graph TD
    Start(Start)
    ForLoop[For i in 1:10]
    Condition1{i < 3}
    Next[Next iteration]
    Print[Print i]
    Condition2{i >= 5}
    Break[Break loop]
    End(End)
    
    Start --> ForLoop
    ForLoop --> Condition1
    Condition1 -- Yes --> Next
    Condition1 -- No --> Print
    Print --> Condition2
    Condition2 -- Yes --> Break
    Break --> End
    Condition2 -- No --> ForLoop
    Next --> ForLoop
```

## Add emojis as visual aids into text

Ask the AI tool to include relevant emojis within the requested content. These emojis can serve as nice visual aids to written content like notes.

```markdown
Steps to make a PBJ sandwich. 
Add helpful emojis into steps. 
```
```markdown

Sure, here are the steps to make a PBJ sandwich with emojis:

1. 🥪 Gather your supplies: two slices of bread, peanut butter, jelly, and a knife. 🍞
2. 🥜 Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread. 🥪
3. 🥜 Wash the knife. 🧼
4. 🍓 Spread jelly on the other slice of bread. 🥪
5. 🥪 Put the two slices of bread together, peanut butter and jelly sides facing each other. 🥪
6. ✂️ Cut the sandwich in half. 🥪
7. 🥪 Enjoy! 😋
```

## Unit testing

Provide function(s) in your prompt and ask for unit tests. This is useful for package development or data analyses involving custom functions.

```markdown
Give me few unit tests for the following R function using 
the testthat package: `[insert function here]`
```

## Regular expressions

Get a regular expression for pattern matching. Share an example string and the subset you would like to capture then ask for a pattern to match for it. Ensure that you create or obtain one or more unit tests to confirm it is working as expected.

``` markdown
Regex pattern in R that looks for function names that are 
not prefixed by package name. For example it should not 
detect `dplyr::count(iris, Species)` or 
`dplyr::glimpse(iris)`
```

## Commenting code

Add beacons or useful comments into existing code. Beacons are parts of a script that can help a programmer understand what the code does. These could be as a simple, one-line comment explaining a section of code or a function. Alternatively, they could be variables using words that help explain what the code is doing. This could mean variables like tree or root for a code involving a binary tree.

```markdown
Add short comments after each line in the R code explaining what is going on:
flights |> 
  filter(dest == "IAH") |> 
  mutate(speed = distance / air_time * 60) |> 
  select(year:day, dep_time, carrier, flight, speed) |> 
  arrange(desc(speed))
```

```markdown
# Pipe operator (|>) is used to chain functions together for data manipulation.
# Filter rows where the 'dest' column is equal to "IAH".
flights |> 
  filter(dest == "IAH") |> 
# Calculate the 'speed' column by dividing 'distance' by 'air_time' and then multiplying by 60 to convert to minutes.
  mutate(speed = distance / air_time * 60) |> 
# Select specific columns 'year' to 'day', 'dep_time', 'carrier', 'flight', and the newly calculated 'speed'.
  select(year:day, dep_time, carrier, flight, speed) |> 
# Arrange the rows in descending order based on the 'speed' column.
  arrange(desc(speed))
```
## Explain concepts

Ask to explain a new concept you are learning in a format of interest or style of interest.

```markdown
Explain how programmers typically use regular expressions. 
Give me a few  situations where it might be applied. 
Explain this to me in the style of Robert Dinero.
```
## Write code

Ask for help to write code and automate repetitive coding tasks. The key is to provide an accurate technical specification for the tool to work with. In other cases, you could get an example on how to do something, similar to a tutorial, then apply it to your situation.

``` markdown
Show me how to read a set of CSV files from a folder in R using list.files(), readr::read_csv(), and the purrr package. 
Set the element names as the csv file names. 
Note that I dont want to change the working directory and dont want to set the element names at the full file paths.
```

```markdown
# Load required libraries
library(readr)
library(purrr)

# Specify the folder path where the CSV files are located
folder_path <- "/path/to/your/folder"

# Get a list of CSV files in the folder
csv_files <- list.files(path = folder_path, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# Read CSV files and set element names
csv_data_list <- set_names(map(csv_files, read_csv), basename(csv_files))

# Now, csv_data_list is a named list where each element contains the data from the corresponding CSV file.
# The names of the elements are set to the CSV file names without the full file paths.
```
## Debug code

Get help to identify, understand, or fix problems in your code. Here it helps to define expectations.  

```markdown
Help me debug this R code:
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) %>%
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = island))
```
## Explain code

Get explanations for blocks of code that you may have difficulty understanding.

```markdown
Explain the following code to me:
stringr::str_view(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
```

## Refactor code

Refactor your code that may be inefficient or unnecessarily complicated. For example, maybe you are defaulting to looping structures like for or while loops when you could be using vectorized solutions. 

```markdown
Refactor this R code to take advantage of vectorization:
x <- 1:5
y <- 10:15
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  output_vector[i] <- x[i] + y[i]
}
output_vector
```
```markdown
x <- 1:5
y <- 10:15
output_vector <- x + y
output_vector
```

## Reformat code

Rearrange code so that it is more readable and understandable.

```markdown
Reformat this R code so that is more readable and follows good R conventions:
1+            1
x=1:10#some users prefer '<-' as the assignment operator
if(TRUE){
print('Hello world!') # HI!
}
```

```{r}
#| eval=FALSE
# Adding two numbers
result <- 1 + 1

# Creating a sequence from 1 to 10
x <- 1:10 # some users prefer '<-' as the assignment operator

# Conditional statement with a print statement
if (TRUE) {
  print('Hello world!') # HI!
}
```

## Translate from language to language

Convert code from one language to another. Of course, here you want to ensure you have unit tests in place and the ability to understand both languages.

```markdown
Convert the following R code into python using 
packages like pandas or numpy:
flights |> 
  mutate(
    gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
    speed = distance / air_time * 60
  )
```

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame called 'flights'
flights['gain'] = flights['dep_delay'] - flights['arr_delay']
flights['speed'] = flights['distance'] / flights['air_time'] * 60
```

## Write documentation

Explain what kind of R package or analysis you are working on then ask the AI tool to create a `README.md` template for an R package. Additionally, you could use it to create in-line documentation as comments for your functions. This is commonly done in R using the [roxygen2 package](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/).

```markdown
Give me a roxygen2 header for this R function to 
redact email addresses from a string: 

redact_email_addresses <- function(
text, 
replace_with = NULL) {
    pattern <-
      "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}(?:\\.[A-Za-z]{2,})?\\b"
    redact_pattern(text, pattern, replace_with)
}
```

## Write a professional email

Provide an informal email or message to the AI tool and ask the tool to make it professional based on the intended audience or recipient.

```markdown 
Please update the following email to ensure it is business 
professional: `[insert email content here]`
```

## Naming things

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton

Well, AI tools can help you name things. For example, you could ask the AI tool to provide you could share the intended purpose for the function you're working on then ask the AI tool for one or more informative function names. 

```markdown
Give me 5 possible names for an function that creates a 
hex sticker from a reference image. Use snake case 
for the names.
```

## Generate art for a logo

AI tools like DALLE can be used to get creative artwork for later use as book cover art or a hex sticker.

```markdown
