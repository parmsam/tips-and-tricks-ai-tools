# Uses

## Memory aid

Obtain list of possible mnemonics to help memorize a concept. These could be an acronym or funny story. Alternatively, you could ask for a description to help you map the information into your memory palace.

### Example prompt

``` markdown
Give me a list of 5 memory devices to remember
$ vs ^ in regular expressions
```

## Transforming information

Summarize educational content into a list of bullet points or table. Content be a video transcript or an article. Or you could go in the opposite direction and ask for a description of a table or set of bullet points.

## Unit testing

Provide function(s) in your prompt and ask for unit tests. This is useful for package development or data analyses involving custom functions.

```markdown
Give me few unit tests for the following R function using 
the testthat package: `[insert function here]`
```

## Regular expressions

Get a regular expression for pattern matching. Share an example string and the subset you would like to capture then ask for a pattern to match for it. Ensure that you create or obtain one or more unit tests to confirm it is working as expected.

``` markdown
Regex pattern in R that looks for function names that are 
not prefixed by package name. For example it should not 
detect `dplyr::count(iris, Species)` or 
`dplyr::glimpse(iris)`
```

## Commenting code

Add beacons or useful comments into existing code. Beacons are parts of a script that can help a programmer understand what the code does. These could be as a simple, one-line comment explaining a section of code or a function. Alternatively, they could be variables using words that help explain what the code is doing. This could mean variables like tree or root for a code involving a binary tree.

## Explain concepts

Ask AI tool to explain a new concept you are learning in a format of interest or style of interest.

## Write documentation

professional: `[insert email content here]`
