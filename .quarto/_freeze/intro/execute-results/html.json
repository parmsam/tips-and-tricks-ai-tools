Alternatively, get a description or story that can help you map the information into a memory palace.\n\n### Example prompt\n\n`Give me a list of 5 memory devices to remember $ vs ^ in regular expressions`\n\n\n```{rmd}\nSure! Here are five memory devices to help you remember the differences between the symbols \"$\" and \"^\" in regular expressions:\n\nDollar Bill: Think of the symbol \"$\" as a dollar bill. Just like a dollar bill comes at the end of a transaction, the \"$\" symbol is used in regular expressions to match the end of a line or string. It signifies that the pattern must occur at the very end.\n\nCaret Cap: Visualize the symbol \"^\" as a caret cap. Just like a caret cap sits on top of something, the \"^\" symbol in regular expressions is used to match the beginning of a line or string. It indicates that the pattern must occur at the very beginning.\n\nTail Ender: Imagine the symbol \"$\" as a tail ender. When you see the \"$\" symbol in a regular expression, think of it as the pattern chasing the tail end of the line or string to find a match.\n\nStart Pointer: Consider the symbol \"^\" as a start pointer. When you encounter the \"^\" symbol in a regular expression, think of it as the pattern pointing to the start of the line or string to search for a match.\n\nAnchors Away: Associate the symbols \"$\" and \"^\" with anchors. The \"$\" symbol acts as an anchor at the end, ensuring the pattern is anchored to the very end of a line or string. On the other hand, the \"^\" symbol acts as an anchor at the beginning, ensuring the pattern is anchored to the very start of a line or string.\n\nRemembering these mnemonic devices can help you recall the distinctions between the \"$\" and \"^\" symbols in regular expressions.\n```\n\n\n## Transforming information\n\n\n- Summarize educational video transcripts or articles into a list of bullet points\n  - Convert such information into a table\n\n## Unit testing\n\n- Provide function(s) in your prompt and ask for unit tests. This is useful for package development or data analyses involving custom functions.\n\n## Regular expressions\n\n- \n\n## Commenting code\n\n- Add beacons into existing code.
